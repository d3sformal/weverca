<h1>Silverlight and PHP</h1>

<p>In this article I will provide an overview of Silverlight, which is a plug-in for web browsers, 
  which simplifies development of rich internet applications. Rich internet application (RIA) is
  quite popular term in these days - it usually referst to applications that run in the web browsers, 
  but provide functionality similar to desktop applications. This can be achieved using various 
  technologies ranging from pure AJAX solutions, to applications that use Flash or Java on 
  the client-side. Silverlight is a project developed by Microsoft based on .NET and it provides an 
  alternative option to these technologies. There are various reasons why you may consider Silverlight
  as the right platform for you, but I believe that the most compeling reason is that you can choose
  from a wide range of programming languages to program the application running in the web browser.
  Aside from standard .NET languages, Silverlight supports Python, Ruby and - thanks to the Phalanger 
  project - also PHP and indeed, we will focus on the PHP support available for Silverlight in this 
  article.</p>

<h2>Silverlight and Phalanger</h2>
<p>Let me first shortly introduce Silverlight and Phalanger - the two projects that make it possible to
  write code running in the web browser in PHP language. Phalanger was already discussed in php|architect in 
  the November 2007 issue.

<h2>Creating Silverlight Smiley in PHP</h2>

<p>After the introduction, you may be thinking that there are to many different concepts
  in Silverlight that you have to understand before starting, but I believe that the first 
  example will show the opposite. In this example, we will write almost everything
  directly in PHP. We will still need a XAML file, but it will contain just the necessary code 
  for loading Phalanger and we will of course need HTML page (or server-side PHP script) where the 
  Silverlight control can be embedded.</p>
<p>In the first example we will look how to manipulate with simple Silverlight graphics and we will 
  start with a code that creates a smiley. Later, we will look how to add animations and how
  the Silverlight object can respond to mouse events. To make the code very simple, the smiley
  will be composed of a yellow ellipse and a transparent PNG image with eyes and mouth. You could of 
  course create the whole icon just using Silverlight shapes, but it would be more work - we will return 
  to more complicated graphics later and mention the tools that you can use to produce graphics for 
  Silverlight.</p>

<pre>
&lt;? // Listing 1 - 'sample1.phpx'
include("slutils.phpx");

slcreate("Canvas", array(
  "Canvas.Name" =&gt; "smiley"), 
  array(
    slcreate("Ellipse", array(
      "Ellipse.Name" =&gt; "face",
      "Width" =&gt; 100,
      "Height" =&gt; 100,
      "Fill" =&gt; "#FFFF00")),
    slcreate("Image", array(
      "Source" =&gt; "Smiley.png"))),
  $canvas);
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>Let's now examine the code in listing 1. It starts with an <code>include</code> directive, which includes
  functions and classes from <code>slutils.phpx</code> file. This file is available with Phalanger and it 
  contains a set of useful Silverlight extensions for PHP language. These extensions make it easy to manipulate
  with Silverlight directly from the PHP code using various wrappers and functions. The first sample is written 
  mostly using these functions, but later we will also look at some more advanced topics, where we will work with 
  Silverlight objects directly.</p>

<p>The rest of the code consists of several calls to function <code>slcreate</code>, which comes from the 
  <code>slutils.phpx</code> file and can be used for creating Silverlight controls from PHP in a convenient way.
  In the code we use it to create a <code>Canvas</code> control, which serves as a container for other controls
  and for creating <code>Ellipse</code> and <code>Image</code> controls in this container. The reason why we
  use a container is that it makes it easier to change location of the whole smiley later.</p>
<p>The <code>slcreate</code> function is rather flexible - it has four parameters and the last two are optional.   
  The first parameter speicifes a name of the control (e.g. <code>"Ellipse"</code>). The second required parameter
  is an associative array that specifies properties of the object, so for example when creating an ellipse, 
  we set width and height to <code>100</code> using this associative array. The third parameter is again
  an array, but this time it is just a list of child controls of the newly created control. We use this
  parameter when creating the canvas to specify two child controls of the canvas - that is the ellipse and
  an image that form the smiley. Finally, the last parameter specifies the parent of the newly created control
  - this is useful if you want to add new children to already existing control. In our code we use this feature
  when creating the canvas that contains the smiley, because we want it to be added to the Silverlight object
  in web browser, which is stored in a global <code>$canvas</code> variable (this variable is also declared in the
  <code>slutils.phpx</code> file).</p> 
<p>Note that two of the properties contain a dot in the name of the property. This is a bit unusuall extension
  that Phalanger adds to allow using so called <em>attached properties</em> from Silverlight. These properties
  are not declared as a part of the object and have to be set in a non-standard way, but this is handled in the
  <code>slutils.phpx</code> file. We will shortly discuss attached properties later, so for now it is just 
  important to remember that <code>Name</code> is an attached property and has to be set using this dot-syntax.
  This means that in this sample, the entire smiley has a name "smiley" and the ellipse has a name "face".
  Names are in many ways similar to IDs from HTML, because they can be used for manipulating with the objects,
  once these are created.</p>
<p>Now that we know how the PHP code that creates our smiley looks, we should also look at the 
  HTML page and XAML file. The HTML page in listing 2 is quite simple, but it requires a bit of JavaScript to load
  the Silverlight object. This code is similar for all Silverlight applications and can be copied from an existing 
  project, so you won't need to write it by hand. The page refers to a <code>Silverlight.js</code> file,
  which handles the loading and is provided with Silverlight. The page later uses <code>createObjectEx</code>
  function to load the XAML file, which is specified as one of the arguments.</p> 

<pre>
&lt!-- Listing 2 - 'sample1.html' --&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="Silverlight.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id="slHost" 
  style="width:800px;height:600px;"&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    Silverlight.createObjectEx({
      id: "slControl",
      source: "sample1.xaml",
      parentElement: document.getElementById("slHost"),
      properties: { width:"100%", height:"100%", version:"1.1" },
      events: {}
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>The listing 3 shows the content of the XAML file which is embedded in the HTML page above. The XAML
  file serves as a container for all the visible controls and in our example with smiley, the
  <code>$canvas</code> variable refers to a root <code>Canvas</code> object in the XAML file.   
  Usually most of the controls are created in the XAML file, but in the first example we focused on
  the PHP-side of thing, but we will look at some examples that use XAML for creating controls further. </p>
<p>As already mentioned, the XAML file format is based on XML, so you can easily recognize that the file in 
  the listing 3 declares a root element <code>Canvas</code>, which represents a container for all the
  Silverlight controls. The root element has several attributes that specify basic properties (like width
  and height) and also defines XML namespaces for the document. The declaration of XML namespace <code>php</code>
  is interesting, because it imports controls from a specified .NET namespace of a DLL library - in this case 
  <code>PhpNetCore.dll</code>, which is a core Phalanger library and this library also defines the 
  <code>PhalangerLoader</code> control, which is created inside the canvas. As you can see, the control
  has only <code>Source</code> attribute and specifies the PHPX file, which we examined earlier. The control
  doesn't create any visible content and just loads and executes the specified PHPX file, so it used
  as an entry-point for any Silverlight control implemented using Phalanger.
</p>

<pre>
&lt!-- Listing 3 - 'sample1.xaml' --&gt;
&lt;Canvas Width="800" Height="600" Background="White"
    xmlns:php="clr-namespace:PHP.Silverlight;assembly=ClientBin/PhpNetCore.dll"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/client/2007"&gt;
  &lt;php:PhalangerLoader Source="sample1.phpx" /&gt;
&lt;/Canvas&gt;
</pre>


<h2>Adding Animations to the Smiley</h2>
<p>Now we have a nice smiley living in the Silverlight control, but that's still not showing any 
  rich graphical capabilities of Silverlight, so let's add some animations. An animation that we will add 
  will change the color of the ellipse that forms the smiley face. When we created the ellipse earlier, 
  we assigned a name to this control, so we can access it by its name, which is "face".</p>
<p>The traditional approach to animations that you use for example in JavaScript is to create a timer
  and change the property (in our case a color) every time the timer ticks, however this makes the
  code quite complicated even for very simple animations, so in Silverlight a different approach is 
  used. We will simply 'say' that we want to change the color of the face from yellow to red in 400 
  milliseconds and then back to yellow and we'll leave Silverlight to handle the timers automatically. 
  This is exactly what the following code does:</p>
<pre>
slcreate("Storyboard", array(
  "Storyboard.Name" => "anim", 
  "AutoReverse" => true), array(
  slcreate("ColorAnimation", array(
    "From" => "#FFFF00",
    "To" => "#FF4000",
    "Duration" => "0:0:0.4",
    "Storyboard.TargetName" => "face",
    "Storyboard.TargetProperty" => "(Fill).(Color)"))),
  $canvas->Resources);  
</pre>
<p>As you can see we're again using the <code>slcreate</code> function. This is because animations
  are similar to other elements and controls that you can use in Silverlight and are created
  using a declarative programming style. The code creates a <code>Storyboard</code>, which can contain
  and control one or more animations. The animations are created as a children of the storyboard.
  In our example we create just a single <code>ColorAnimation</code> which changes a color of the
  object between colors specified by the <code>From</code> and <code>To</code> properties.
  The two properties that specify what should be animated ar probably the most important part.
  The <code>Storyboard.TargetName</code> specifies a name of the control that we're animating 
  (in our example this refers to a "face" ellipse created earlier). The <code>Storyboard.TargetProperty</code>
  is a path to the property that should be animated. In our example, we want to animate <code>Color</code>,
  which is a property of the brush that specifies how the ellipse is filled, so we need to access
  the <code>Fill</code> property of the ellipse first and then the <code>Color</code> property of 
  the brush. The braces around the property name are required, because some properties can contain a dot 
  in the name - these are called <em>attached properties</em> and we shortly mentioned them earlier,
  but we will get back to them in one more example later.</p>
<p>The last thing that we have to do is to start the animation. The storyboard has a name "anim",
  so we can access it directly by the name using the global <code>$canvas</code> variable. This is
  an example, where PHP is really flexible, because we can use this syntax even when the animation
  (or a control) that we want to access is created at runtime:</p>
<pre>
$canvas->anim->Begin();
</pre>

<h2>Adding Mouse Events to the Smiley</h2>

<p>As a next step, we will add a handling of mouse events to our code. We will do something quite simple
  - when user clicks on the smiley, the smiley will start the animation that we created earlier and
  it will move to another place on the screen. We will also create a counter that counts the number
  of times user clicked on the smiley.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that interactive applications (be it a Silverlight content or other type 
  of GUI application that can be created using Phalanger) work in a different way than usual server-side
  PHP code. In these interactive application, some code executes at the beginning, but it stays loaded
  in the memory until the application is closed, so when user performs some action, the state of the
  application is stored in memory and can easily respond to the action. In our example with smiley this
  means that we will write a function that will move the smiley and we will tell Silverlight to 
  call this function when user clicks on the image. Using the Silverlight terminology, we will register
  an event handler (the function that should be called) to a <code>MouseLeftButtonDown</code> event of the image.  
</p>
<p>Before looking at the events and event handlers, we will first add a single global variable to 
  count the number of clicks and we'll import a .NET namespace using <code>import namespace</code> directive.
  This is a non-standard PHP language extension in Phalanger that makes it possible to use .NET namespaces 
  (however they will be replaced by PHP 6 compatible namespaces in the future). In this case we're 
  importing a namespace that contains some classes that we'll need later for our event handling code
  (note that <code>import namespace</code> must be the first thing in your source file):
  </p>
<pre>
import namespace System:::Windows:::Input;

global $count;
$count = 0;
</pre>
<p>Next, we'll create a <code>TextBlock</code> element. <code>TextBlock</code> is simply a control that 
  displays some text and we will use it for displaying the number of the clicks on the smiley. We will
  need to change the displayed text, so we need to assign a name (<code>"txt"</code>) to the control.
  The code is using the <code>slcreate</code> function, which we already discussed:</p>
<pre>
slcreate("TextBlock", array(
  "TextBlock.Name" =&gt; "txt",
  "Canvas.Top" =&gt; 10,
  "Canvas.Left" =&gt; 300,
  "FontFamily" =&gt; "Arial",
  "FontSize" =&gt; 20,
  "Text" =&gt; "Count: $count"), array(),
  $canvas);
</pre>

<p>Now, we can finally start implementing our event handler. We will write a function that 
  starts the animation created earlier, moves the smiley to a random location and displays
  incremented count of the clicks in a <code>TextBlock</code>, which we just created:</p>  
<pre>
function OnClick()
{
  global $canvas;
  global $count;
  
  $canvas-&gt;anim-&gt;Begin();
  $canvas-&gt;smiley-&gt;{ "Canvas.Left" } = rand(100, 600);
  $canvas-&gt;smiley-&gt;{ "Canvas.Top" } = rand(100, 500);
  $canvas-&gt;txt-&gt;Text = "Count: ".(++$count);
}
</pre>
<p>The code that starts the animation and changes the text isn't using any new concepts. It simply
  uses the global <code>$canvas</code> variable to access the elements created earlier and
  sets its properties. The code that sets position of the smiley however shows two interesting new things.
  The first thing is that we can use standard PHP functions like <code>rand</code> even when running in
  Silverlight. This is possible because Silverlight version of Phalanger contains an implementation of 
  many standard PHP functions. Second, we're using an interesting syntax for setting the property. This 
  is because we're setting <em>attached properties</em> that can be accessed using a name with dot character.
  This is an extension that can be used thanks to wrappers provided by the <code>slutils.phpx</code>.</p>
<p>Attached properties used for setting a location are a good place to explain what is the purpose of 
  these. The location of a control is clearly managed by the parent <code>Canvas</code> element, so 
  it doesn't make much sense to specifying a coordinates of a control that will not be placed in a canvas.
  This is why attached properties exist - they are present in the control only when it is created in 
  some specified context, where the properties make sense. In our example this means that setting these
  properties makes sense only when the smiley is placed in a canvas, wich also explains the name
  of the property - the part before a dot specifies the owner of the property and the part after the dot
  specifies the name of the property. </p>
  
<p>Finally, we have to tell Silverlight, that it should call our <code>OnClick</code> function when
  user clicks on the smiley:</p>
<pre>
$canvas-&gt;smiley-&gt;MouseLeftButtonDown-&gt;Add
  (new MouseEventHandler("OnClick"));
</pre>
<p>The code uses an event called <code>MouseLeftButtonDown</code>, which has an <code>Add</code> method. 
  This method can be used for registering a methods that should be called when the event occurs. Silverlight 
  requires the argument to be an instance of special object that represents the event handler, so we have
  to create the event handler first. This is a concept that comes from .NET, so the same principle is used
  in other kinds of GUI applications created using Phalanger. The event handler can take either a name
  of a function as an argument or an array with a reference to an object and a member function name if you want
  to call a member function of an object when the event occurs.</p>

<h2>Creating Elements Using XAML</h2>
<p>So far in the article we slightly overlooked the XAML files and we focused on creating 
  Silverlight content from the PHP code. Although creating content programatically is very important 
  (and in PHP it is quite ellegant thanks to the extensions provided by <code>slutils.phpx</code>), 
  it is usually easier to create some parts of the GUI declaratively using XAML. </p>
<p>As already mentioned, XAML is based on XML and it is in many ways similar to HTML. When creating
  a Silverlight control declaratively, you just create XML element with the same name as the control
  and use XML attributes to specify properties of the control. XAML is published on the web as a plain
  text, which also has one very important advantage - the content (for example text displayed using
  <code>TextBlock</code> element) can be indexed by web search engines. Finally, XML (and therefore also XAML)
  is very tool-friendly format, so you can create your XAML files in any editor which supports XML. Also,
  it can be generated by various tools and graphical editors. Aside from Microsoft Expression familly tools,
  which are in particular focused on XAML, there is also a plugin allowing export of XAML content from Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<pre>
&lt!-- Listing 4 - 'sample2.xaml' --&gt;
&lt;Canvas Width="800" Height="600" Background="White"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/client/2007" 
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml" 
    xmlns:php="clr-namespace:PHP.Silverlight;assembly=ClientBin/PhpNetCore.dll"&gt;
  &lt;php:PhalangerLoader Source="sample2.phpx" /&gt;
  
  &lt;Canvas.Resources&gt;
    &lt;Storyboard x:Name="anim" AutoReverse="true"&gt;
      &lt;ColorAnimation From="#FFFF00" To="#FF4000" 
        Duration="0:0:0.4" Storyboard.TargetName="face" 
        Storyboard.TargetProperty="(Fill).(Color)" /&gt;
    &lt;/Storyboard&gt;
  &lt;/Canvas.Resources&gt;
  
  &lt;Canvas x:Name="smiley"&gt;
    &lt;Ellipse x:Name="face" Width="100" 
      Height="100" Fill="#FFFF00" /&gt;
    &lt;Image Source="Smiley.png" /&gt;
  &lt;/Canvas&gt;

  &lt;TextBlock x:Name="txt" Canvas.Top="10" Canvas.Left="300" 
    FontFamily="Arial" FontSize="20" Text="Count: 0" /&gt;
&lt;/Canvas&gt;</pre>

<p>Let's now look at the listing 4, which shows exactly the same smiley face as we created 
  earlier in the article, but this time created declaratively using XAML rather than programatically
  from PHP code. The root <code>Canvas</code> element with XML namespace declarations and
  the <code>PhalangerLoader</code> element (which specifies what PHPX file contains the
  program code of the application) were already discussed earlier. The root element then contains
  an element called <code>Canvas.Resources</code> - this doesn't specify a new control to be 
  created and instead serves as a more flexible way for setting properties of the root element.
  When the name of the element contains a dot character, it means that we're actually setting
  a property of the parent element, so the element <code>Canvas.Resources</code> specifies
  that we're setting <code>Resources</code> property of the root canvas. You may be wondering
  why the complicated syntax? The answer is that sometimes you want to assign a complex value to some
  property and this syntax gives us a way for creating the value of the property using 
  XAML elements.</p>
<p>In the example we first create a <code>Storyboard</code> and add it to the root canvas resources.
  The <code>Storyboard</code> contains one animation which has the same properties as the 
  animation created earlier in the code. Finally, the root element contains two child elements
  that simply declare two controls - the <code>TextBlock</code> element, which displays the count and 
  a <code>Canvas</code>, which represents the smiley composed of an ellipse and an image.  
</p>
<p>The file containing the PHP code for this example is quite similar to what we already created
  in the first example, so we won't include a complete listing here. The only difference is
  that all the calls to <code>slcreate</code> function can be removed, because the controls 
  are created by Silverlight runtime from the XAML file in listing 4. This means that the file will
  contain only the <code>OnClick</code> function and the code that registers an event handler for
  the <code>MouseLeftButtonDown</code> event.
</p>

<h2>Communicating with The Server-Side</h2>
<p>There are many advanced topics that we could discuss, but probably the most important topic
  when developing any real-world application is manipulation with data. In client-server 
  environment this topic is almost essential. Silverlight applications run on the client
  (as a component in the web browser), so they form the client-side tier of the distributed
  application. The server-side tier will usually be PHP running on the server, but Phalanger support 
  for Silverlight doesn't require any specific server-side environment - it can be standard PHP,
  Phalanger running on the server or any other server-side technology. Finally, the data tier 
  is typically an SQL database server, which can be accessed from the server-side code. </p>
<p>The typical requirement will be to load and visualize some data on the client-side or collect 
  some data from the user and submit them to the server. For this, we need a server-side 
  code that will connect to the database and publish the data or process the request with entered
  data and store the data in the database. In this section we show how to connect from the 
  client (Silverlight application running in a web browser) to the server (in our next example 
  PHP code on a web server). As you can easily guess, the communication will be done using
  mechanism similar to the famous XML HTTP request, so the client can send HTTP requests
  to the server. We'll implement a simple application that displays famous quotes 
  and loads a new quote from the server when some event occurs on the client.</p>
  
<p>As you're already familiar with all the boilerplate code, the following snippets present just
  the important part of the code. The first one shows the XAML markup that creates controls
  needed in this example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;php:PhalangerLoader Source="sample3.phpx" /&gt;
&lt;TextBlock x:Name="quote" 
  Text="Click below to load a quote!"/&gt;
&lt;TextBlock x:Name="new" Text="New quote" Canvas.Top="30"
  Foreground="Blue" TextDecorations="Underline" /&gt;
</pre>

<p>As a next thing, we will implement a server-side PHP script (<code>sample3.php</code>) that 
  will generate a random quote. The script doesn't have any arguments, but the parameters
  could be send either using HTTP GET/POST mechanism or as a raw POST data (in that case you
  could read it for example from <code>php://input</code> stream):</p>
<pre>
header("Cache-Control: no-cache"); 
$quotes = array(
  "Life, loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it.",
  "Life? Don't talk to me about life!",
  "I've got this pain in all the diodes down my left side.",
  "I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed.");
echo $quotes[rand(0, sizeof($quotes))];  
</pre>
<p>This is a standard PHP script running on the server, so there is nothing complicated.
  The only thing that is worth mentioning is that the script generates a different content
  for every request and so we have to disable caching in the web browser. The page will be
  requested by the XML HTTP request from Silverlight, but it still supports caching, 
  so we would get the same quote every time.</p>

<p>Let's now move to the client-side. As in earlier samples, we'll need to write a function
  that will handle <code>MouseLeftButtonDown</code> event of a control. In this example we want to
  handle click events of the control called <code>new</code>, which simulates a hyperlink. When user
  clicks on the control, we want to send an HTTP request to the server and request the page <code>sample3.php</code>,
  which we implemented earlier. A typical way for downloading a web page in PHP is using <code>fopen</code>
  function, which also supports HTTP protocol:</p>
<pre>
$fh = fopen(sl_mkabsolute("sample3.php"), 'r');
$canvas-&gt;quote-&gt;Text = fgets($fh);
fclose($fh);    
</pre>
<p>The <code>fopen</code> function requests a data from HTTP path only when the URL starts with
  <code>http://</code> prefix and otherwise it treats the path as a relative file path, so we
  need to specify a complete URL. If you know the location of your application, you can use
  a string, but if you want to request an URL relatively to the URL of the HTML page loaded currently
  in the web browser, you can use <code>sl_makeabsolute</code> function provided by Silverlight.
  This function uses <code>HtmlPage</code> object from Silverlight, which reveals the current
  URL and combines this URL with the given argument, so in this example the HTML page URL 
  (something like <code>http://svr/sample3.html</code>) will be combined with <code>sample3.php</code>
  and the result will be <code>http://svr/sample3.php</code>.
  Finally, if you want to specify additional properties for the request, you can use the 
  <code>stream_context_create</code> function. You can specify POST or GET method, additional
  POST parameters or raw POST data.</p>
