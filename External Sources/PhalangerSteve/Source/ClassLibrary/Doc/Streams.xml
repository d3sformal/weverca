<method name="Filter">
  <summary>
  Processes the <paramref name="input"/> (either of type
  <see cref="string"/> or <see cref="PhpBytes"/>) data through this filter
  and returns the filtered data in one of these formats or <c>null</c>.
  </summary>
  <remarks>
  A filter may hold data in its own buffers when it's unable
  to process whole the input. However, when closing is <c>true</c>,
  it should pass as much data as possible because it is the last call
  to Filter.
  </remarks>
  <param name="input">A <see cref="string"/> or <see cref="PhpBytes"/> containing 
  the data to be filtered.</param>
  <param name="closing"><c>true</c> if this is the last call to this filter.</param>
  <returns>
  A <see cref="string"/> or <see cref="PhpBytes"/> containing 
  the filtered data or <c>null</c> if no output is available yet.
  </returns>
</method>

<method name="Append">
	<summary>
	Appends a filter to the chain of stream-filters of the <paramref name="stream"/>.

	<remarks>
	The filter is attached to the read filter chain if the file was opened for reading 
	(i.e. File Mode: <c>r</c>, and/or <c>+</c>); attached to the write filter chain if the file 
	was opened for writing (i.e. File Mode: <c>w</c>, <c>a</c>, and/or <c>+</c>). 
	</remarks>
	<param name="filter">The name of the filter - either built-in or previously
	defined using <see cref="PhpFilters.Register"/>.</param>
	<param name="stream">The stream which filter-chain is to be extended with the <paramref name="filter"/>.</param>
	<returns>True if successful.</returns>
</method>

<method name="Prepend">
	<summary>
	Prepends a filter to the chain of stream-filters of the <paramref name="stream"/>.
