    Weverca web is a simple user-friendly GUI for Weverca tool, which can be used as an alternative to Weverca console application.
    It is written in ASP.NET MVC 4 under .NET framework 4.5. Framework version is required because Weverca is written in mentioned version.
    It is not needed for the web interface itself.
</p>

<p>
    The user interface consists of a PHP code editor, checkboxes which tells the framework if we want to run verification and what metrics we want to run.
    After the analysis is finished, a page with results appears. There is again the analyzed code and several tabs with results.
    There are warnings in the first one, metrics result in the second one and all program points in the last one.
</p>

<p>
    User can choose from several pre-entered PHP codes to analyses. User can also input custom code, or alter any of the pre-entered ones.
</p>

<p>
    There are two memory models implemented in Weverca. Web interface allows to choose memorymodel for analysis.
</p>

<p>
    There is timeout for the analyses to avoid server overload. It is currently set to {0:### ##0}ms.
